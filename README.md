## Overview
The app will be developed in Swift code and Cocoa Frameworks, an objective-C framework that focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP). Since the app deals with alerts and notes, it might be possible to have it point into the device’s internal calendar and clock to further enhance the user’s experience. The app would allow user inputted data (deadlines) and it will assign them to a specific slot on the canvas, changing the color depending on the user’s settings or tag event.

Originally the group planned to develop the app solely in Swift, but due to issues with access to XCode, the group decided to also develop in Java. 

The app will be developed in Java and Android Studio, an objective-C framework that focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP). Most of the group member use laptops with Windows 10, and Apple does not provide XCode with support for Windows. Due to this, the group decided to pivot and also develop in Java using Android Studio.
