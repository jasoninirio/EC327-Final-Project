# Some Guidelines To Keep Things Organized:

### When commiting keep in mind of some **flags**:
- **Added** - Added new content
- **Removed** - Removed existing content
- **Tweaked** - Tweaked existing content for better optimization, etc.
- **Fixed** - Fixed bug/issue, make sure to @user (do not @ if you fixed the bug yourself)
- **Bug** - When there's a bug, for help you should @user\
For example:
```
Added [Content]
Removed [Content]
Tweaked [Content]
Fixed [Content]: Description with @jasoninirio (or whoever's problem you fixed)
Bug [Content]: Description with @jasoninirio (or whoever you want to look into your code)
```
